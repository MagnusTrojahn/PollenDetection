# PollenDetection
This code is used to train a YOLOv8 model.
It includes splitData, this class includes a method that splits a large dataset into training and validation images.
It includes trainModel, which runs a shell scritp to train the YOLO model. (This requires ultralytrics to be installed on your system)

We are attempting to use the YOLO model to identify, count and classify pollen types in a microscope. The repository therefore includes:
